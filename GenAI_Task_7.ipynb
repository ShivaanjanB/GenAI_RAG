        "The biggest lesson I learned through this task that I can't just treat an AI like a chatbot when I'm doing tasks like analysis or computation. When I first asked the AI to compare Block and PayPal, it gave me a generic answer saying they were both just \"fintech companies.\" But when I used the Atom of Thought technique (which forced the AI to slow down, cut the genericity and fluff, and think in steps) I realized that Block isn't just a payment app, it's basically a crypto fund in disguise. If Bitcoin crashes, Block gets hit twice (losing revenue and losing the value of their own assets), while PayPal stays safe. This proved to me that to get in-depth answers, I have to give the AI strict rules, otherwise it will just tell me what I already know."

PayPal’s model is \"asset-agnostic\"—it earns fees regardless of what users buy. Block’s model is \"asset-dependent\"—its balance sheet holds Bitcoin, and its growth engine (Cash App) relies on crypto engagement.\n",

PayPal faces only the former. Investors should view Block not just as a payment processor, but as a hybrid fintech/crypto-holding entity, carrying volatility risks that do not exist in PayPal’s efficiency-focused model."
